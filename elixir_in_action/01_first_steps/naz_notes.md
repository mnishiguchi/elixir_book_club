I didn't quite agree with the merits of code simplification for OTP for the sake of simplification, especially having struggled to get started with OPT as a framework. It almost felt at times I should go back to Erlang and learn it there and come back to "nicer syntax" later.

While I don't mind the "staircasing", I definitely enjoy the `|>`!
