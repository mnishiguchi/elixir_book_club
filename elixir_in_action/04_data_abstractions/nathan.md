# 4 Data Abstractions

* Enjoyed the chapter but disagreed with some of his abstrations in certain subchapters

## 4.1

* Hardest thing to remember in moving from OO to Functional is swithing to use of modules over "." syntax.
* Structs are only different from Maps in that they have a key value pair of `{__struct__: __MODULE__}`
* Interesting to understand why Structs don't match maps, but maps match structs.
* data is always transparent. __GOOD TO KNOW__
* `[structs: false]` is kinda cool. lets you go down the rabbit hole. kinda reminds me of macros and the AST
* `IO.inspect/1` is awesome!

## 4.2

* Structs in modules are not scoped to the module if you are in a namespaced module. that's wierd!
* Compound Matches for data type assertions, nice!

## 4.3

* protocols are cool, but I'm not how they fit into the program architechture.
