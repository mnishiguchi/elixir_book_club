# *Elixir in Action* Reading Group

We're a group of elixir enthusiasts from the DC Metro area.
Our mission is to read and discuss _Elixir in Action_.

We're starting at a pace of one chapter per week; we'll discuss the chapter at
our weekly Hangout. Everyone is encouraged to take notes for each chapter.
Above, you'll see chapter folders; just create a markdown file with your name
and start writing. We'll rotate though meeting leaders, the person responsible
for facilitating the discussion and ensure that we don't spend too much time
complaining about javascript build tools.

## Meetings

Mondays @ 7:00pm via Google Hangouts
